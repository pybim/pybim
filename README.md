Hi there, my names Marcus and this is my personal Python repositories to share scripts I write to solve problems, automate tasks and overall to increase efficiency and productivity at work. I implement these scripts mostly through RevitPythonShell, PyRevit and Python nodes within Dynamo in Autodesk Revit.   

Any code you find here is open and free to use as you wish, with no guarantee by me and no obligation or liability on my part.
